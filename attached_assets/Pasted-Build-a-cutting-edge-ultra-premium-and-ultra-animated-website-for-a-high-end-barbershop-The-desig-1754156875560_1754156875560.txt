Build a cutting-edge, ultra-premium, and ultra-animated website for a high-end barbershop. The design should scream modern luxury—visually minimalist but packed with seamless animations and fluid motion. Every element, from headers to buttons to images, should feel alive and dynamic. Prioritize motion and experience, not just content.

⚠️ This site MUST feel:

Elite and luxurious

Modern and minimalistic

Smooth and immersive, with world-class animation quality

💡 Use inspiration and visual cues from: https://www.kingsbarbershop.site. Match its layout, typography, and entire feel—but elevate it with even more animation polish.

✅ Key Requirements:
Vercel-ready project structure (use Next.js 14 or latest stable, and ensure it runs flawlessly with zero config on Vercel)

Tailwind CSS for styling with custom configuration to limit color palette to black, white, and grayscale only

Framer Motion, AOS, or GSAP for advanced page transitions, scroll-based animations, hover microinteractions, and lazy-loaded animated content

Use modern, sans-serif fonts like Inter, Space Grotesk, or Satoshi—no serif fonts, no gimmicky typography

Every component (text, buttons, cards, images, navigation) should feature subtle and responsive animations

Use only rounded buttons with premium hover states

Include three “Book Now” buttons, strategically scattered (hero, services, and sticky or footer)

Fully responsive and touch-optimized; animation logic must work perfectly on mobile and tablet

🧩 Page Sections:
Hero Section

High-impact animated title and background

Includes a bold, animated “Book Now” button
